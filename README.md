# Facial Emotion Recognition

This project can look at a person’s face (from an image or webcam) and guess their emotion, like:
😊 Happy, 😢 Sad, 😡 Angry, 😮 Surprised, 😐 Neutral.

## What it uses

* **Python 3**
* **OpenCV** – to detect faces from images or webcam
* **TensorFlow / Keras** – to train and use the deep learning model
* **FER-2013 dataset** – for training the model
